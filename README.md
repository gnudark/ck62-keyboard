# ck62-keyboard
If you is like me: Braziian guy and using a 66% keyboard from Motospeed and did not find a correct accentuation {~,',",`} this repository contains scripts for ck62 keyboard if using Windows or MacOs environment

# For Windows Environment
You need to install AHK (https://www.autohotkey.com/) and then use ck62-windows.ahk. With AHK binary installed, you only need to compile this .ahk generating .exe file. So put this binary to initialize with your Windows. 

# For MacOs Environment
You need to install Karabine Elements (https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) and then use ck62-macos.json (putting inside ~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications folder). After install go to Complex modification tab then click + Add item (you'll see all options).
